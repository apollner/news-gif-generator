# News GIF Generation
This repository contains a Python script that automatically generates a GIF based on a news headline. The script uses the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch the latest headlines, and then generates a GIF using the [DiffusionPipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) from the `diffusers` Python package for Text-to-Video task.
The script is scheduled to run every few minutes. Each time it runs, it fetches a new headline and generates a new GIF, which is then displayed below. The GIF generation process is performed on a GPU.
