# News GIF Generation
This repository contains a script that generates an GIF based on a news headline. The GIF is then saved and displayed in this README.
The news headline is fetched from the NewsAPI and the GIF is generated using the DiffusionPipeline from the `diffusers` Python package. The GIF generation process is performed on a GPU.
The script runs every few minutes, fetching a new headline and generating a new GIF each time.
